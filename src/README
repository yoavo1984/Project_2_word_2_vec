Readme for Project 2.

The project has 4 relevant modules:
-----------------------------------

1. dataset - In charge of reading, processing and enabling access to the dataset which
   in this exercise comprises of the datasetSentences file.

2. Evaluations - In charge of the evaluations part and creating the deliverable's.

3. learning - Holds the gradient descent(ascent in out case) class in charge of preforming
   mini batch gradient ascent and it's equivalent hyperparameters class.

4. model - Holds the model,  and the model file holds the alpha unigram model as well.
   Also stores the model hyperparameters.

We have documented each class quite extensively so we will explain the flow of
the program here and the class explanation can be find inside the files.

Main Flow
=========
You need to set the desired hyper parameters in the configuration file.
Then run main.py.

First we load the data (in dataset.py), then split the data to train and test using
the sentence assignments file.
We change the words in the corpus to ids, for faster retrieval and processing.

We build the unigram model inside the SkipGram model class.
So the model will use this class to sample k words.

After the model was initialized we start the learning
as described in the project and class notes.
